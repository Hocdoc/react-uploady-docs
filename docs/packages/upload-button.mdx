# @rpldy/upload-button

Renders a simple (un-styled) button that initiates file upload by opening the browser's native file selection dialog.

Buttons can use different configuration overrides that supersede the options passed to the parent Uploady.

:::info
Some options cannot be overriden by the button. For example, any prop that influences the file input directly (such as '_multiple_')
