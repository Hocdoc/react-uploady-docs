## Details

Upload button component and asUploadButton HOC

The _UploadButton_ component renders a simple (un-styled) button that initiates file upload by opening the browser's native file selection dialog.

Buttons can use different configuration overrides that supersede the options passed to the parent Uploady.

:::info
Some options cannot be overridden by the button. For example, any prop that influences the file input directly (such as '_multiple_')

## Example

### Simple Upload Button

This examples shows how you add Uploady and UploadButton to your app.
This is all it takes to get file uploading to work in your React app.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Uploady from "@rpldy/uploady";
import UploadButton from "@rpldy/upload-button";

const App = () => (<Uploady
    destination={{ url: "https://my-server/upload" }}>
    <UploadButton/>
</Uploady>);
```


:::note
_asUploadButton_ makes it possible to gain access to the underlying component with a [ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html).
To support this, it passes along a ref to the component you provide it. For functional components,
you'd need to wrap your component with [React.forwardRef](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactforwardref).
