## Installation

npm install @rpldy/safe-storage
```

## Details

provides safe versions of localStorage and sessionStorage that don't throw because
of browser issues like safari in private mode.

exposes the same storage API as the browser's API -

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage

In case storage isn't supported, the same API is available but will be replaced with no-op versions.
