## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @rpldy/simple-state
```

## Details

Deep proxies an object, so it is only updateable through an update callback.
outside an updater, it is impossible to make changes

It only proxies simple objects (not maps or sets) and arrays

It doesn't create new references and doesn't copy over anything

**Original object is changed!**
