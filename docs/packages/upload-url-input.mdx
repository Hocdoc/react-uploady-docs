## Details

Input component to enter a URL (or any string for that matter) that will be sent as an upload.

This can be useful for services that accept a URL and do server-side fetch.
[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) is such a service.


## Example

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from "react";
import Uploady from "@rpldy/uploady";
import UploadUrlInput from "@rpldy/upload-url-input";

const MyUrlUpload = () => {
    const uploadRef = useRef(null);

    const onClick = () => {
        if (uploadRef && uploadRef.current) {
            uploadRef.current(); //initiate upload
        }
    };

    return <Uploady>
        <UploadUrlInput placeholder="URL to upload"
            uploadRef={uploadRef} />

        <button onClick={onClick}>Upload</button>
    </Uploady>;
};
```
