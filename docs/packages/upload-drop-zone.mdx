## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @rpldy/upload-drop-zone
```

## Details

Drop zone (container) component to initiate file and folder content uploads
Supports individual files as well as recursively iterating over a dropped directory to upload its contents.

Uses [html-dir-content](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-dir-content) to process the files/directories in the dnd events ([DataTransferItem](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransferItem)).

Can easily be combined with other D&D solutions.

Drop Zones can use different configuration overrides that supersede the options passed to the parent Uploady.

:::note
Some options cannot be overriden by the button. For example, any prop that influences the file input directly (such as '_multiple_')
:::

## Example

Simple example, shows how upload options can be passed to the drop-zone (grouped, maxGroupSize).

```jsx
import Uploady from "@rpldy/uploady";
import UploadDropZone from "@rpldy/upload-drop-zone";

const App = () => (
    <Uploady destination={destination}>
        <UploadDropZone
					onDragOverClassName="drag-over"
					grouped
					maxGroupSize={3}
				>
            <span>Drag&Drop File(s) Here</span>
        </UploadDropZone>
    </Uploady>);
```
