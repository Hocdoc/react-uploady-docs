## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @rpldy/native-uploady
```

## Details

This is the main UI package for React-Native. Its role is to initialize and expose the [uploader](rpldy-uploader) functionality.
It contains the Provider that all other UI packages rely on.

It provides multiple hooks that enable more advanced features and data for client apps.

:::note
The difference between this package and the main [Uploady](rpldy-uploady) is that
this one doesn't use react-dom (for obvious reasons) and doesn't create a file input element.
:::

## Example

To be able to use one of the [UI Components](../api/components) or one of the [hooks](../api/hooks), you need to wrap them with Uploady.
This will give them access to the UploadyContext.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import NativeUploady from "@rpldy/native-uploady";

const App = () => (<NativeUploady
    grouped
    maxGroupSize={2}
    method="PUT"
    destination={{ url: "https://my-server", headers: { "x-custom": "123" } }}>

    <Upload/>
    <RestOfMyApp/>
</NativeUploady>)
```
