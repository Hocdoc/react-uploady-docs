## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @rpldy/mock-sender
```

## Details

Provides a mock sender that can be used to replace a real sender for testing purposes.

As it provides the same interface and events as a real sender,
the Uploader works the same as if files were actually being sent.

On-progress events and abort functionality are supported
