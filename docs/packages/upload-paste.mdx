## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @rpldy/upload-paste
```

## Details

Enables Paste-To-Upload functionality. User can paste in a file from the clipboard to initiate an upload.

The main feature is the `withPasteUpload` HOC, which allows any component to become a trigger of paste-to-upload.
A user pasting (ctrl/cmd+v) a file or files while focused on the element will trigger an upload.

## Example

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Uploady from "@rpldy/uploady";
import { withPasteUpload } from "@rpldy/upload-paste";

const Container = ({ children }) => <div>{children}</div>;

const PasteArea = withPasteUpload(Container);

const MyApp = () => {
	return <Uploady destination={{ url: "my-server.com/upload" }}>
        <PasteArea>
            Paste file here to upload
        </PasteArea>
    </Uploady>;
};
```
