## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @rpldy/uploader
```

## Details

The Uploader is the processing and queuing engine for React-Uploady.
When files are handed to the Uploader, it will represent each file as a [Batch Item](../getting-started/concepts#batch-item) and group them together in a [Batch](../getting-started/concepts#batch).

The Uploader fires Batch & BatchItem lifecycle [events](#events) that can be registered to.
Some of these events also allow to cancel uploads dynamically.

_If you're looking to integrate file upload with your React app, you'd probably want to head over to the [@rpldy/uploady page](rpldy-uploady).
