# Yoav Niran

## Creator of React-Uploady

By day, I'm a R&D Team Lead @[cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com). At other times, an aspiring sci-fi novelist.

I wrote my first sci-fi novel: [White Clouds](https://whitecloudsbook.com), and I'm working toward self-publishing it.
If you're into sci-fi (space operas), please consider checking it out.

I'm currently writing my second book, also sci-fi, unrelated to the first one.
