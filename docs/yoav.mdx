# Yoav Niran

## Creator of React-Uploady

I started this project in the beginning of 2020 (just before Covid-19 locked us in) as a way to learn but also with the intent of building a cohesive and useful library
that others may benefit from.
It has been a great ride so far with all of the objectives above achieved and much more.

I am thrilled anew every time I hear someone is using this library or finds it brings value.

I manage and maintain this library on what little free time I find.
Please consider supporting the work I do here by donating at: [React-Uploady on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/react-uploady).

## Who am I?

By day, I'm a R&D Team Lead @[cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com). At most other times, an aspiring sci-fi novelist.

I wrote my first sci-fi novel: [White Clouds](https://whitecloudsbook.com), and I'm working toward self-publishing it.
If you're into sci-fi (space operas), please consider checking it out.

I'm currently writing my second book, also sci-fi, unrelated to the first one.
