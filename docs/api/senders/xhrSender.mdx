## Package

- **_[@rpldy/sender](../../../packages/rpldy-sender)_**

## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @rpldy/sender
```

## Details

```typescript
type send = SendMethod
```

- See: [SendMethod](../../types#sendmethod)

This is the default send method used by [Uploady](../../../packages/rpldy-uploady)/[Uploader](../../../packages/rpldy-uploady).

Normally, it is used internally and there is no reason to interact with this method directly.

However, [Enhancers](../../../getting-started/concepts#enhancer) may want to wrap the send functionality with some custom logic.

## Example

```jsx
import { Uploady } from "@rpldy/uploady";
import { send } from "@rpldly/sender";

const mySend = (items, url, sendOptions, onProgress) => {

	//implement some custom logic here

	return send(items, url, sendOptions, onProgress);
};

 const MyApp = () => {
    return <Uploady send={mySend}>
      <RestOfMyApp/>
    </Uploady>;
};
```

Alternatively, you can also create a reusable enhancer that will set your custom send method:

```jsx
const myEnhancer = (uploader) => {
	//make uploader use the custom send method
    uploader.update({ send: mySend });

	return uploader;
};

 const MyApp = () => {
    return <Uploady enhancer={myEnhancer}>
      <RestOfMyApp/>
    </Uploady>;
};
```
