## Package

**_@rpldy/uploady_**

## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @rpldy/uploady
```

## Details

```typescript
type useFileInput = (fileInputRef?: InputRef) => InputRef
```

When customInput prop is set to true, Uploady will not create its own file input element.
In this case, Uploady will wait for a ref to an existing input.

The way you pass in your own input element is by using this hook.

In case Uploady wasn't provided with a destination prop or if it doesn't have a URL property,
Uploady will check whether the input resides in a form. It will then use the form's action and method to set the upload endpoint and request method.

> In case the form's attributes were used for the upload destination, updating the form's attributes dynamically won't affect the uploader configuration once it was set.

See [InputRef](../types#inputref) type.

## Example

```javascript title=WithCustomFileInputAndForm.jsx
import Uploady, { useFileInput } from "@rpldy/uploady";
import UploadButton from "@rpldy/upload-button";

const MyForm = () => {
    const inputRef = useRef();
    useFileInput(inputRef);

    return <form action="/upload" method="POST">
        <input type="file" name="testFile" style={{ display: "none" }} ref={inputRef}/>
    </form>;
};

export const WithCustomFileInputAndForm = () => {
    return <section>
        <Uploady
            debug
            customInput
        >
            <MyForm />
            <UploadButton/>
        </Uploady>
    </section>
};

```
:::info
This hook can also be used to retrieve Uploady's internal file input. Calling the hook without parameters will return the ref.
