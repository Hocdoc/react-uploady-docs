## Package

**_[@rpldy/uploady](../../../packages/rpldy-uploady)_**

## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @rpldy/uploady
```

## Details

```typescript
type useBatchErrorListener = BatchEventHook;
```

- See: [BatchEventHook](../../types#batcheventhook)
- See: [Batch Entity](../../entities#batch)

:::note
Event Hook - [BATCH-ERROR](../../events#batchError)
:::

Called in case batch failed with an error.
These errors will most likely occur due to invalid event handling.
For instance, by a handler (ex: BATCH_START) throwing an error.

:::info
This event can be scoped to a specific batch by passing the batch id as a second parameter
:::

## Example

```javascript
import { useBatchErrorListener } from "@rpldy/uploady";

const MyComponent = () => {
    useBatchErrorListener((batch) => {
        console.log(`batch ${batch.id} had an error: ${batch.additionalInfo}`);
    });

    //...
};
```
