## Package

**_[@rpldy/native-uploady](../../packages/rpldy-native-uploady)_**

## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @rpldy/native-uploady
```

## Props

This provider's props are just about identical to the main [Uploady](..) provider.
See Uploady's [Props](..#props) documentation.

:::note
All props are identical besides the ones related to file input (ex: multiple, accept, etc.), which cannot be used with the native flavor.

## Example

```jsx
import React, { useCallback } from "react";
import { View, Button } from "react-native";
import DocumentPicker from "react-native-document-picker/index";
import NativeUploady from "@rpldy/native-uploady";

const Upload = () => {

  const pickFile = useCallback(async () => {
      const res = await DocumentPicker.pick({
        type: [DocumentPicker.types.images],
      });

      uploadyContext.upload(res);
  }, [uploadyContext]);

    return (
			<View>
				<Button title="Upload File" onPress={pickFile} />
			</View>);
};

const App = () => (<NativeUploady
    grouped
    maxGroupSize={2}
    method="PUT"
    destination={{url: "https://my-server", headers: {"x-custom": "123"}}}>

    <Upload/>
    <RestOfMyApp/>
</NativeUploady>)
