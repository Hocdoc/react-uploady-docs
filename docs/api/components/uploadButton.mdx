In addition, most UploadOptions props can be passed to UploadButton, in order to override configuration passed to the parent Uploady component.
See [Uploady documentation](../api/providers/uploady#props) for detailed list of upload options.

The following [guide](../guides/DifferentConfiguration.md) shows how different upload buttons may use different upload options.
