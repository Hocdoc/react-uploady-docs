## Installation

npm install @rpldy/tus-sender

## Details

```typescript
type clearResumables = () => void
```

By default, the tus-sender will store the URLs for uploaded files, so it can query
the server for their status and skip chunks that are indicated as uploaded.

The URLs are persisted to local storage.
This method allows you to clear the URLs that were previously persisted.
