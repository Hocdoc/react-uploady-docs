# @rpldy/upload-button

Renders a simple (un-styled) button that initiates file upload by opening the browser's native file selection dialog.

Buttons can use different configuration overrides that supersede the options passed to the parent Uploady.

:::info
Some options cannot be overriden by the button. For example, any prop that influences the file input directly (such as '_multiple_')

## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @rpldy/uploady
```

## Props

| Name (* = mandatory) | Type          | Default       | Description
| --------------       | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
| id             | string            | undefined | id attribute to pass to the button element
| text           | string            | "Upload"  | the button text (in case no children passed)
| className      | string            | undefined | the class attribute to pass to the button element
| children       | React.Node        | undefined | child element(s) to render inside the button (replaces text)
| extraProps     | Object            | undefined | any other props to pass to the button component (with spread)
| ref            | React ref         | undefined | will be passed to the button element to acquire a ref
| onClick        | EventHandler      | undefined | function to handle button click (called after showing the system's file selection dialog)

In addition, most UploadOptions props can be passed to UploadButton, in order to override configuration passed to the parent Uploady component.
See [Uploady documentation](../providers/uploady#props) for detailed list of upload options.

The following [guide](../guides/DifferentConfiguration.md) shows how different upload buttons may use different upload options.
