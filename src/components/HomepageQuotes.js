// What a fantastically compact, well-designed, well-documented and simple-to-use library! Perfect for a relative React newbie like me - you just saved me at least two weeks of trying to figure out how to hook up progress indicators and implement multiple (batch) file upload. And I realize that's only scratching the surface of the functionality available. Many thanks, and many kudos!
